Introduction
The depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental impact of conventional water pumping systems have urged us to explore sustainable alternatives. Harnessing solar energy to power water pumps is an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution. To further enhance its efficiency, we have integrated a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. This algorithm utilizes historical data on electricity loads, weather conditions, and other relevant environmental factors to forecast future energy demand.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical electricity load data and corresponding dates. It is represented in the following format:

Predictive Algorithm
The heart of this project lies in the deep learning-based predictive algorithm. We employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to forecast the future electricity loads. These models are trained on the historical dataset and have been fine-tuned to optimize their accuracy and generalization capabilities. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can provide precise predictions that adapt to varying weather and environmental conditions.

Working Prototype
We have developed a working prototype of the Solar-Powered Water Pumping System integrated with the predictive algorithm. The hardware components include high-quality solar panels, energy storage units, a water pump, and necessary control systems. The predictive algorithm runs on a dedicated microcontroller that regulates the operation of the water pump based on the forecasted electricity loads.

Visualization
Load Forecasting Visualization

The graph above illustrates a visualization of the actual electricity load (dashed line) and the predicted load using both RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models. The x-axis represents the number of days, while the y-axis indicates the electricity load in kilowatts (kW). The accuracy of the predictions showcases the effectiveness of our deep learning-based approach.
